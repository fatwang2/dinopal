## 📥 Installation

1. **Download and Install**: Download the DinoPal installation package from the Releases section and complete the installation.
2. **"App is Damaged" Solution**:
   - If you see a "The app is damaged" warning, don't worry. This happens because we don't have an official Apple Developer account yet, triggering macOS's built-in security.
   - You can resolve this issue by running the following command in the Terminal:

   ```bash
   sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/DinoPal.app 
   ```

   > ⚠️ **Note**: `/Applications/DinoPal.app` is the default app installation path. If you installed it elsewhere, adjust the path accordingly.
