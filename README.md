## ðŸ“¥ Installation

1. **Download and Install**: Download the DinoPal installation package from the Releases section and complete the installation.
2. **"Not Opened" Solution**:
   - If you see a "Not Opened" warning, don't worry. This happens because the version you are installing has not been audited by Apple yet, triggering macOS's built-in security.
   - You can allow it to open by going to the Mac's settings-privacy & security and manually allowing it to open. Here is a tutorial video:
